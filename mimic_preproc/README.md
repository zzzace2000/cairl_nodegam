Subfolder with all pertinent info to get stuff out of raw mimic.
Any scripts to query raw mimic directly should live in here.

Dirs:
raw-data: this dir should ONLY ever contain the full csv dump of mimic-iii-v1.4
query-data: where we write stuff out to when we pull from raw-data
extract-scripts: where to store all the scripts that take stuff from raw-data and extract to query-data
